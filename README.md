# NUS Dev Knowledge Hub

This repo serves as an overall knowledge hub for the NUS Marketing Development team.
It is a collection of list of tools, extensions, resources, instructions, documentation, and overall helpful content.
The purpose of this is to keep the team and the codebase organized, simpler, and consistent as to leave us more time to focus on tasks at hand instead of small pesky errors one could make.

In the root of the repo you will find commonly used dev files, such as dotfiles.

Make sure to read the [Docs](https://nationaluniversitysystem.github.com/dev-knowledge-hub/) for more content, code guide, and more.
