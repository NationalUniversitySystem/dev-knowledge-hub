- [PHP DocBlocker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neilbrayfield.php-docblocker) - Keep your code documented. No need to add a comment for every line. Use naming conventions, breathing room (space), and other methods to make your code understandable as it's read line by line. This extension is more to help do block docs for files, functions, classes, and methods and give an understanding of these, their parameters, etc. [_Similar_ Atom Ext.](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr)
- [phpcs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ikappas.phpcs) - Keep your code clean and up to WP/WPVIP/NUS team standards.

[Atom Ext.](https://atom.io/packages/linter-phpcs)
- [SASS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robinbentley.sass-indented) - Supported for indented SASS.
- [VS Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - Real time code collaboration, so like Google docs but for code. Ever need help from a team member outside the office? Forget screenshots, use this.
- [WordPress Snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tungvn.wordpress-snippet) - Gives you suggestions for WP Snippets as you type, in case you forget any of them but remember partial function names.
