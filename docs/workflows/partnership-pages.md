# Partnership page workflow:

## NU (WES):

- Create a new page
- Add content from copy
- Update `Page Attributes`:
    - Parent: `Workfoce Education Solutions`
    - Template: `Standard Hero Sidebar`
    - Request `Campaign Activity` and `Organization` field values:
        - Once page is in development, add the URL in the [NU_Partnerships_Organizational](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEYuLWvMCTCFmRUPbL8ZS9cw-igYbr7VZauYH1utfhQ/edit?ts=5e7e76d5#gid=1054635506) and notify April Resurreccion (to direct a comment type `+` followed by her email address: AResurreccion@nu.edu)
        - April will add the **Organization MKT_WES** and **Campaign Activity** values in the spreadsheet and notify web dev.
        - Apply these values to the `Form Setup` metabox
            - **Campaign Activity** field value
            - **Organization** field value
        - When page is ready for testing, include April as an approver to the project (2nd to last approver before Jordan) to ensure values are being populated correctly and that data is passed through from Eloqua to CRM
- There is no need to add a hero image, it should be automatically displayed. Unless otherwise noted in the job description.
- If you need to add the partner logo to the sidebar, create a `custom field` with the name `sidebar_content` and add any HTML you need in the value field.  
(i.e. `<img src="/wp-content/uploads/xxxx/xx/partner_logo.png" class="any-class-here" alt="The Partner logo.">` - **Do not forget to include the `alt` attribute.**)
- Once the page goes live, switch the development URL to the live URL in the [NU_Partnerships_Organizational](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEYuLWvMCTCFmRUPbL8ZS9cw-igYbr7VZauYH1utfhQ/edit?ts=5e7e76d5#gid=1054635506) spreadsheet
