# Plugin updates procedures

Because we are using Git, code is lockdown and plugins cannot be updated in the dashboard.
As best practices go, this is so that no one can update plugins on the production environment without any initial approved testing.
Plugins should have Git changes reviewed and tested locally before any merge occurs.
Make sure to:
- Update only one plugin per Pull Request.
- Include the PR title and number in [Release notes](https://github.com/NationalUniversitySystem/dev-knowledge-hub/wiki/Release-procedures).

When updating plugins there are a few main methods:
- Download from source.
- Update plugin via admin dashboard locally.
- Composer dependencies update.

## Download from source
Straight forward manual method of updating. Usually reserved for premium plugins like [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/).
- Download plugin from website.
- Install locally and test.
- Branch off `develop` using branch naming convention `plugins/{plugin-slug}`.
- Commit with message structure "Update {Plugin Name} plugin vX.X.X -> vX.X.X".
- When doing PR into `develop`, if possible, in the **Description** area include the Changelog or a link to the changelog.

## Update plugin via admin dashboard locally
The more traditional way of updating WP plugins.
- In the Plugins page for the site (or network page for MU installs), update one plugin per Pull Request.
- Branch off `develop` using branch naming convention `plugins/{plugin-slug}`.
- Commit with message structure "Update {Plugin Name} plugin vX.X.X -> vX.X.X".
- When doing PR into `develop`, if possible, in the **Description** area include the Changelog or a link to the changelog.

## Composer dependencies update
In the root of the project files there _should_ be a composer.json file with project dependencies.
These will include plugins and sometimes one or more of our own skeleton/parent themes.

The team utilizes [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-github-dependabot) to help us manage dependencies. They are usually set up to check for WP plugin updates on a weekly basis on Wednesdays, but they should generally be focused on every other week (not an option for time in Dependabot config at time of this guide's publishing). Dependabot will create PRs which can be used to update the pugins that _should_ have the head set as `develop`.

- Switch to the appropriate branch created by Dependabot.
- While in the root folder of the project, run `rm -Rf vendor && composer clearcache && composer install`.
	- To save time, an alias can and should be created. Example: `alias gitcomposerupdate='rm -Rf vendor && composer clearcache && composer install';`.
- Review changes and confirm that the update works with the rest of the project's codebase.
- Make a commit to the branch with _only_ files from the intended plugin being updated.
	- Commit with message structure "Update {Plugin Name} plugin vX.X.X -> vX.X.X".
- Keep both the Dependabot "bump" commmit and your Update plugin commit (i.e. do not squash the commits).
- Manage PR per usual.
