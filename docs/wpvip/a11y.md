As you may already know, Web accessibility is a more complex issue than can be solved with a plugin; however, other than best practices in code, there are a few things we can do that may have a significant impact on web accessibility. Let me point you to a few resources on the topic:

The [Accessibility Handbook from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/about/accessibility/) is an excellent collection of resources and best practices in Content and Design along with Code.

Your development team should follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/), which in the past have been considered by the courts to meet ADA standards. For WordPress core itself, the WordPress coding standards state:

All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) at level AA.

We encourage you to include accessibility testing in your front-end testing to address issues like contrast errors, or missing alt text.

This blog post has a great 60-second accessibility test:

Inclusive Design Principles, is another great resource, since accessibility does not only belong in the testing phase of a project:

And although automated testing cannot catch everything, there are some excellent accessibility checking tools, including:

The WAVE checker:

Axe automated testing
https://www.deque.com/axe/
(also powers the Chrome accessibility audit - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference)

Firefox accessibility inspector:

Finally, for many well-known accessibility best practices, it's important to make sure editorial staff are informed and on board. For instance, does every editor publishing an article know that their uploaded images need `alt` text?
