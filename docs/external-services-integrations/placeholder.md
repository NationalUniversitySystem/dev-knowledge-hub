## Algolia

Previously used Algolia for sitewide-search functionality. Unclear if we still use or need it?

Dev notes: Cannot test this locally or on preprod. Unfortunately due to (something related to our account or the platform integration) it will only work on production, and thus needs to be tested directly on prod. Not ideal but oh well. If we comment out [these lines](https://github.com/wpcomvip/nu-edu/blob/master/plugins/nuedu-core-functionality/inc/search/class-init.php#L17-L19), we might end up syncing our local stuff with Algolia and that could create some sort of sync issues with production.
