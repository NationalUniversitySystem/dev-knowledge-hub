# Events

- Events sometimes display as different templates based on the category they're tagged in.
	- Since most events are now webinars, make sure to tag the event as a webinar in order for "zoom links" to appear on the front-end.

- Currently there is no easy way to create a recurring event, aside from just manually entering multiple versions with multiple dates. 
	- **@TODO** explore a better dev solution.
