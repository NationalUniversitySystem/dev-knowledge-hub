# RFI Data Routing

There's lots of hidden fields that get set dynamically, based on various criteria.

Data from form submissions typically get sent DoublePositive and Eloqua. The Enrollment team uses OnDemand, which pulls data from DoublePositive sometimes, and from Eloqua sometimes. Nobody really knows how it works (yet!).

WES-related RFI forms will (soon) send data to Marketing Cloud as opposed to Eloqua (?)

You can view/edit the routing via Form Settings->Webhooks
