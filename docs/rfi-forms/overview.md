# RFI Forms

"Request for Information" forms are mission-critical for the marketing department. Please be careful when making form-related updates on production.

When migrating form-related content from preprod to production, please double-check form IDs if applicable. Form ID's are often different across various environments (i.e. a certain form might be form ID #82 on preprod, but ID #86 on production).

## RFI - B2C (Partnership Pages)

## RFI - [other examples...]
