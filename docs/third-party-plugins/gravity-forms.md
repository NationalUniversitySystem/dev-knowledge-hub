# Gravity Forms

!> **Important:** Forms are considered a 'mission critical' element of our website. Please take care when making any form-related changes.

All of our forms are built on top of Gravity Forms. We also include various 'add-ons' (official extensions developed by Gravity Forms) as well as numerous NU customizations (developed by us).

## Add-On: Advanced Post Creation
Plugin Description: "Allows you to create new posts through Gravity Forms."

?> *@TODO* This extension is installed, but deactivated. Is this something we still need or use?

## Add-On: Chained Selects
Plugin Description: "Adds the powerful Chained Selects field type, allowing you to chain multiple Drop Downs together (e.g. Make, Model, Year)."

?> *@TODO* This extension is installed, but deactivated. Is this something we still need or use? Seems like it would be used to dynamically populate degree programs after the user selects bachelors/masters/etc, but I'm pretty sure we have a custom-built solution for that?

## Add-On: Webhooks
This add-on allows us to connect to various third-party platforms. This is important as it is responsible for us being able to route form submission to Eloqua/DoublePositive/etc.
