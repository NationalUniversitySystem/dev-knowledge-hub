# Enable Media Replace

?> Plugin Site: https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/

Adds a "Replace media" upload option, when viewing an attachment from the WP media library. 

Useful for when we need to update PDF's that are manually linked within the content, across of lots of different pages.

[Example](https://www.nu.edu/ouruniversity/theuniversity/partnerships/smud/): Many partnership pages will include a "Degrees Offered Flyer" PDF link in the sidebar. Occasionally this flyer will get updated. Rather than auditing all our partnership pages and manually replacing the links, we can simply utilize this plugin.
