# Widget Logic

Adds 'display logic' field to all widgets, and displays additional settings at the footer of the WP Admin wigets page.

?> @TODO We're currently using this plugin on both `www` and `info` for a couple widgets, but I feel like there are better ways to accomplish this. Might be worth re-visiting how we use widgets, and if there are better ways we can incorpate these components into the site.
