# Yoast

?> Plugin Info: https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo

Plugin used for SEO. Generally considered 'gold standard' for WordPress SEO configuration.

?> *@TODO* Yoast has a reputation for being a very bloated plugin, and it seems like we're really only using it for search meta descriptions. If that's the case, do we really need Yoast? Or are there other features/benefits that I'm missing?
