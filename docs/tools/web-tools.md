# Web Tools

Collection of sites around the web to use during the whole code development process.

## Table of Contents
- [Placeholders](#placeholders)
- [Image Compression](#image-compression)
- [Pagespeed](#pagespeed)

## Placeholders
- [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) - Most basic of placeholder images. For such uses as wireframing or quickly mocking up a dev site.
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) - As their site says, Lorem Ipsum... but for photos.
- [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/) - Like the above but official to Unsplash.com.

## Image Compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Google's public image compressor. Has more options than compressor.io.
- [Compress Image Online](https://compressimage.io/) - New comer (at time of initial commit). Compares itself to Compressor.io and it is Browser based so images are not sent to any servers.
- [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) - Always swore by this site. Really wish it had an API or that I could purchase it.
- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) - SVG Optimizer is a tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.

## Pagespeed
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) - A lot of detail in the resulting report for the testing sites. Lots of options to run the tests including ad blocker, white/blacklisting resources URls, location test, waterfall. An account is required for some features but accounts are free.
- [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) - Google's tool to help you clean up your act but will ding your score for Google Analytics and other resources they provide. Definitely use this tool to get a higher score because this is one of the most popular tools that non-dev people will test against.
- [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com/) - Pingdom's reporting tool.

## Skill Development
- podcasts in tools
