# Placeholder to Expand on in the Future

We have lots of internal custom plugins. Some have lots of parts. Some seem to be legacy things that are unused. At some point we should do a deep dive audit of all internal plugins.

### Gravity Forms - DoublePositive

Custom function to integrate GF with DoublePositive

### Gravity Forms - NUS Customization

Various NU-specific customizations added to extend gravity forms

### NUEDU Core Functionality

Lots of stuff to unpack in this plugin.

### NUEDU Forms

Form-specific stuff... but not stuff that's related to gravity forms? Not clear. Also SMS functionality (currently disabled).

### NUS React WP

Houses the javascript for various react apps (program finder, tuition calculator, etc), and sets up the integration of loading those into WordPress.

### NUS Structure

Handles registering most (but not all?) of our custom post types. Also (I think) handles linking Degree Program->Department->College structure/hierarchy?

### NUSA Search

Customizations to our site search. 
(But we also use Algolia for site search? Is that a separate thing? Does that integrate with this?)
