# SEO

For most of our SEO-related content updates, we can use Yoast. This usually consists of just updating the 'meta description' that gets displayed for a given page in Google search results. This can be accessed within the post content editor, 'Yoast SEO' dropdown section.

### Special Schema
Example page: https://www.nu.edu/studentservices/nu-wellness/coronavirus/
Example page: https://www.nu.edu/ourprograms/college-of-professional-studies/engineering-and-computing/programs/masterofscienceindataanalytics/

In these pages we're using special 'FAQ Page' schema for Google's search results, so the FAQ accordion content shows directly within google search results. We accomplish this by adding schema-related tags to HTML elements within our content.

Test a given page via Google's official "Rich Results" tool: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
