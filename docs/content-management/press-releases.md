# Press Releases

Press releases will (generally) be posted to both of the following pages:
- https://www.nu.edu/news/
- https://www.nusystem.org/category/news/

These are both considered **archive** pages by WordPress. You can't edit them directly, as they're set to automatically pull certain data.

### For NU.edu: 
1) Posts -> Add New, 
2) Select Category: News

### For NUSystem.org: 
1) Posts -> Add New
2) Select Category: News
3) After publishing, manually change 'Author' to **NUSystem**
	- Our display template for NUSystem includes the authorname on the front end. This will default to your wordpress account username, so we need to change it manually.

Although the content for Press Releases is generally pretty basic, double check for minor formatting things. Bold headers where applicable, paragraph line breaks, accurate hyperlinks, etc.
