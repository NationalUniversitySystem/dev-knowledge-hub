# Press Releases

Press releases used to be posted to both nu.edu and nusystem.org; there may still be some legacy code from prior attempts to automate the cross-posting.

Press releases will (generally) be posted to both of the following pages:
- https://www.nu.edu/news/

These are both considered **archive** pages by WordPress. You can't edit them directly, as they're set to automatically pull certain data.

### For NU.edu: 
1) Posts -> Add New, 
2) Select Category: News


Although the content for Press Releases is generally pretty basic, double check for minor formatting things. Bold headers where applicable, paragraph line breaks, accurate hyperlinks, etc.

Examples:
- https://www.nu.edu/news/meb-keflezighi-to-deliver-keynote-address-at-national-university-commencement/
