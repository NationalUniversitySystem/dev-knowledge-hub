# Terms & Conditions Pages

Occasionally need to add a new page for 'terms and conditions' related to scholarships/contests/etc. Generally don't need to stress too much about formatting on these.

A couple examples:

- [StoryStream Terms & Conditions](https://www.nu.edu/storystream-terms-conditions/)
- [Graduate Cap Contest Terms & Conditions](https://www.nu.edu/graduate-cap-terms-conditions/)

### Form Terms & Conditions
Most forms have their 'Terms & Conditions' display via a popup/modal. This text is **not** part of the individual form, but is set at a global level. This can be found via Customizer -> Global Forms -> Terms & Conditions. **Note that making a change to this will change the Terms & Conditions modal for ALL forms across the site**
