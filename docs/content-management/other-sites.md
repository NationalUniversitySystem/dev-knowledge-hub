# Other Sites

Quick notes regarding content management for other sites we manage. For more in-depth information about the following sites, visit the [Other Sites Section](/other-sites/site-inventory.md).

## Harmony SEL
- Events ("Webinars" -- I think for these, it's critical that you tag events specifically as a webinar. That might be a different SEC site though)
	- Also for one of the SEC sites, we need to manually re-visit AFTER each event takes place, and manually move it to 'past webinars'. Future development project to automate that.
- Press Releases
- Lots of the front-page content lives in the WP Customizer, rather than the standard content editor.

## NUSystem.org
- Press Releases
	- Need to manually change 'author' after creating post

## info.nu.edu
- Some templates make heavy use of widget areas for content.
