# Custom Post Types

We use numerous custom post types:

## Programs
- There's also a CPT for 'college' and 'department', and some sort of back-end logic that ties all 3 of these together. There's also an important back-end feature called 'academic hooks' that is based off this, but I'm not sure on the specifics.

## Partnerships

## Faculty

## Locations

## etc...
