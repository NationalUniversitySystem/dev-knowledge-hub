# Placeholder to Expand on in the Future

## Curriqunet API

NU's official course catalog for a given year is hosted on a service called Curriqunet. Ideally looking to use their API to query Program Learning Outcomes and possibly course listings.

## Custom Post Types

We use a wide array of custom post types. Some of these have extensive functionalities built out for them. @TODO expand more on these.

## Location Finder

React-based app integrated within Wordpress, displays NU locations on map overlay. Pulls locations from 'Locations' posts in wp admin.

## Modal/Popup

- Sitewide functionality
- Single-page functionality, which overrides sitewide modal if enabled for a given page
- Integration with Optimizely
	- Currently triggered only via optimizely

## Optimizely Integration

Dashboard Quick Link: [https://app.optimizely.com/v2/projects/9267520140](https://app.optimizely.com/v2/projects/9267520140) (login required)

Managed by Parker Sorenson and Amber Franklin, however we occasionally need to provide custom javascript and/or make tweaks to our templates to accomodate Optimizely.


## Tuition Calculator
