# Central System Plugin

This plugin is what imports program data from the NU Data Object API and updates the forms and program post type. This is also where you will set state restrictions. This plugin needs to be enabled for program pages to work and for the forms to have programs populated in the select menus, so it needs to be activated. If program pages are throwing an error or forms do not have program data, this should be the first thing you check.

This is where you will sync the data from the Data Object API (e.g. IT updates program table)

Here you will be able to:

- Sync Data
- Dry Run (to see what data is being updated)
- Revert Sync
